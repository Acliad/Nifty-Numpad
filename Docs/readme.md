Nifty Numpad is a full sized numpad with an extra row and two extra columns of macro keys. It was created because I wanted a companion to my TKL keyboard for work. My main workflow involves heavy use of ECAD programs, so the design was tailored for that, but it is generic enough to be nice for many workflows! 


The main features are:
- Full sized numpad with row of macro/function keys on the top
- Two extra columns of macro keys
- Cherry MX style socketed switches
- Backlit keys
- 3D printable case (FDM or resin)

# Building One
All of the files needed to build this numpad should be in this repo (with software as a submodule). The total BOM cost will probably be somewhere around $55-$85 shipped, but depends heavily on where and how you source things like switches, keycaps, plate, etc. For example, I bought 120x switches, which is rolled into the $75 estimate. But if you could get 33 switches for cheaper, you might save ~$10. 

## 1. PCB Assembly
The most difficult part of the build is soldering the RP2040 (microcontroller used) and associated components. It is possible to at least all the difficult componentsâ€“maybe all the componentsâ€“assembled by JLC PCB. At this time, however, I have not done the work to make that a one-click purchase. If you would like to contribute, that would be very welcome! ðŸ™‚

That said, if you really would like one of these but can't or don't want to do the soldering, feel free to shoot me a message. 

If you do have experience with reflow soldering (using a stencil), this shouldn't be too difficult. The RP2040 and USB-C connectors can be a little finicky, but with enough flux, anything is possible. 

To create the PCB assembly:
1. Order PCBs (I use JLC, you can use whoever you like).
2. Order a stencil (you can usually do this at the same time as the PCB).
3. Order parts (I have DigiKey PNs in the electrical BOM, but again feel free to substitute)
   - The switch sockets are not available on DigiKey. [I bought mine on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BVH6M5FP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details), but you can source them from most keyboard suppliers.
   - The LEDs come in packs of 10. You can get them from DigiKey or Adafruit, but note if you upload the BOM directly to DigiKey it will put in a quantity of 33, which is actually 330.
4. Solder it!
    - I recommend a reflow oven, but a hot air station or hot plate works too.

You can choose to omit the LEDs if you're not into that sort of thing. It'll save you a few bucks. 

Parts marked as (DNF) in the BOM are not meant to be populated. If you want easy debugging for software development, you can populate R103, SW101, and SW102.

## 2. 3D Printed Case
This case was initially designed to be 3D printed on a resin printer, but it actually prints best on an FDM printer. There are not special instructions here. You can either print the case yourself or have it printed using a service. JLC offers printing of many varieties. Might be a good choice if you're already ordering the PCB from them.

All the screw holes are designed to be tapped by a self-tapping screw. The BOM recommends some plastic-threading screws. 

I have added a "[shadow line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dhFhU7Nl_0)" to the case outline. There's a top-case print option with and without this line. I think it helps the look a bit for FDM prints, but it's up to you. 

## 3. Switch Mounting Plate
I used [plate-mount](https://switchandclick.com/plate-mounted-vs-pcb-mounted-keyboard/) switches on this design. There are services that will cut plate for you in various materials, but I've used flush mounted flat-head screws to secure the panel and the counter sink is an additional operation I don't think most services will do for you. These leaves at least three options:

1. Use the provided 3D model of the plate to 3D print a plate.
   - The plate works, but can be a bit flimsy and makes taking all the switches off the PCB tedious
2. Order or make a custom plate out of your preferred material and countersink the holes.
    - If you know what this means and are comfortable with a drill or drill press, it shouldn't be hard.
    - You could order the plate in FR4 from JLC at the same time you order the main PCB. If you end up making the KiCAD files for this, I'd love to add them to the repo. 
3. Modify the 3D model of the top piece to accommodate pan head screws. 
    - If you do this, I would love to add the file to the repo! It should be easy, I just don't have to time to print and verify right now.

Whatever you choose to do, you should find appropriate files in the Mechanical folder.

## 4. Switches/Keycaps
The fun part! Choose your favorite Cherry MX compatible switches and pop them in. If you're using LEDs, make sure you get switches with a clear top. 

I found it difficult to source backlit keycaps that fit this build well. You might be better off using non-backlit keycaps. There are [some AliExpress sellers](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801609324454.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.18.27561802CbfaCa&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa) who will sell portions of a keyboard at a time so you can mix and match colors. This is what I ended up doing, but I couldn't find any in a uniform profile like XDA or DSA. If you find a good source of keycaps, please share! 

If you're feeling plush, I think the numpad + icono kits of [these keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/drop-biip-mt3-extended-custom-keycap-set?mode%5B0%5D=shop_open&mode%5B1%5D=shop_open&defaultSelectionIds=969832&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=14650997430&utm_term=126026139486&utm_content=545898905914&utm_keyword=&utm_placement=pla-1392002507270&utm_network=u%3Ac%3A%3A&utm_device=&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwlJimBhAsEiwA1hrp5i-AwICvpmNDm80DELJZylLo96oIX7IjxFvtUybMUVPNlUNpxAKwlxoCEOMQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) would be really nice. 

You'll also need 3x 2u plate-mount stabilizers. You can source these from most keyboard part suppliers or Ali Express.

## 5. Software
I've used [QMK](https://qmk.fm) for this build. At the time of writing this, I only have one keymap that's pretty specialized to using Cadence PCB Allegro. However, it should be super easy to modify that keymap to fit your needs. I also plan on adding a better default mode and eventually implementing VIAL. Check the [TODO](#todo) list for planned updates. 

The Nifty Numpad hasn't been merged into the main QMK repo yet, so for now you can find it [here](https://github.com/Acliad/qmk_firmware). 

QMK and the build/flash process is pretty well document, so I'll leave that to the QMK community. If you have specific issues with the Nifty Numpad, feel free to message me.
